## CS50x â€“ Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains all the projects and exercises completed for CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science.

I successfully completed the course, covering topics such as C, Python, SQL, and web development with Flask. All assignments, problem sets, and the final project are included.

Some Python projects require the cs50 library:
```
pip install cs50
```
